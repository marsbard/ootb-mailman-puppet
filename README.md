ootb-mailman-puppet
===================

I failed to build groupserver with puppet, then I noticed that puppet has some inbuilt 
type for maillist, currently supporting mailman as a provider.

<s>Also there is this project https://github.com/thias/puppet-mailman which can be used to initialise the provider</s> I changed this to use nwaller-mailman
